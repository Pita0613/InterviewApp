## Description
Welcome to the BUS Team interview app. This application is a sample application written in .Net 4.8.

Your challenge is to refactor the UserService class, specifically the AddUser method. Assume the code is sound in terms of business logic (i.e. it functions correctly). Your focus should be on bringing the impelentation in line with modern software practices like SOLID, KISS, DRY, and YAGNI.

Try to keep your effort under 2 hours. If you still see further opportunities after that time period, write them down and share them with us.

## Limitations
The Program.cs class in the InterviewApp.Consumer project may not change, and any changes made must be backwards compatible with the Consumer. This includes adding using statements. Assume that this code base is part of a great systems and any non-backwards compatible changes will break the system.

You can change anything in the InterviewApp project except for the UserDataAccess class and its AddUser method. Both the UserDataAccess class and the AddUser method MUST remain static.
